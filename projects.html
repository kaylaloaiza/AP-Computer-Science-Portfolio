    <p>Our Scratch Project is a story, the story is Little Red Riding Hood and you can interact with it. The purpose of the story is to interact with it and to come up with the ending while chosing which path to take. We created this program using Scratch.com</p>
    <p>The development of our Scratch project is that </p>

    <p>The program I created with my partner is a Hangman game! The purpose of the program is to let the user have fun playing a classic game of hangman. We created the game using Repl.it.com with Python 2.7. The program lets the user play actual hangman and guess till they get the correct word!</p>

    <p>The App project I created with my partner is a App call Quotable. We developed this app using MITapp invenetor. My partner and i wanted to have an app where when you open it, it will show you inspirational quotes. The purpose of the app is to let the user have inspirtational quotes for them on their phone.</p>

    <p>My infographic that i created was on Interplanetary Lander. I created this infographic on canva.com. What a Interplanetary Lander is a lightweight but strong space lander that could be deployed to planets beyond Mars. This Lander will help NASA find more life on different planets, they have their eyes on distant moons around other planets than earth.</p>
    <h2>Investigate with Data</h2>

    <p>My presentation for Investigate with data was on music. My partner and i reallly enjoyed music and we wanted to incorparte that in our project. To find the data, we had a few issues. We didn't really know what we were searching for because actual CDs were hard to find data for since downloads and digital albums are more popular in our generation. We eventually found a list of the most downloaded digital albums for each week of 2018 on the billboard website. All we had to do is look at the list and see which artist was on the list multiple times to see how much their albums were downloaded in 2018. We decided to use the artists for our data because it would be easier to tally up rather than just using their albums. To create the chart, we used Excel online which allowed us to type in the data we had collected to quickly create the graph.</p>

    <p>My project is call Rocket. I created my program using Scratch. I wanted to create a game that was very fun and kid friendly. The incremental development process of my program was very simple. The difficulties i encountered was getting the scoring to work. What i would encountered was everytime “Rocks” would hit the edge of the screen, the points will go crazy. I tried multiple techniques for I can get the scoring code correct. What i did to fix my mistake is, i added a wait code, so every one second, the points will go up because that is how long it will take for “Rocks” to reach the bottom of the screen. Some opportunities i encountered when creating my code was being able to let the user move the rocket. What i did here, was i developed a code that only let the user move the rocket from side to side using the arrows. I created this development independent.</p>

    <p>For my explore project, I created was a computer innovation which is the Ring Doorbell. Its purpose to to let the buyer to be notify who is at their door and for safety. My computerational artifact represents the computing innovations purpose by showing how it looks, how you can use the app and displays how you can see people through the app.</p></center>
