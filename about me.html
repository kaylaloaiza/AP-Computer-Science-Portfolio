    <center><p>My name is Kayla Loaiza, alittle bit about myself is that i am a very creative person. I love photogrpahy alot, ever since i was small and able to hold a camcorder i would record everything! Since i was little, i didn't know how to work it at all so i recorded over alot important stuff like weddings and parties. I guess that is why i love photography and/or anything that deals with capturing a moment because it makes me the happiest. Another thing about me is that i love being outside and off my phone, i feel like these past years i lost out on so much because i was on my phone doing absouluty nothing. I love listening to music, i listen to everything. One day i would be listening to current music and the next day im all for the 70s or the 80s. I also listen to a bunch of other music too!</p></center>
